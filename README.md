# psRESTUtilities
Utilities that may be handy when using REST for Oracle SaaS applications

#GETTING STARTED
Requires Python 3.7.x
Requires xlrd for reading .xls and .xlsx files

Download psRest.xml, psRESTUtilities.py to a directory
Change parameters in psRest.xml

Note, although .xlsx can be used .xls is used in general but only required when converting background colors to a Hex RGB value since the xlrd library only supports this with .xls

psData.xls and psPostData.py are examples of using these utilities
